<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves setting up and managing an Active Directory (AD) home lab environment using Windows Server 2019. The lab is designed to simulate a real-world enterprise network, providing hands-on experience in AD administration, remote access configuration, and network services management.
<br />


<h2>Main Goals</h2>

- <b>Develop proficiency in Active Directory administration and automation using PowerShell.</b> 
- <b>Gain practical experience in managing Group Policy Objects and Security Groups.</b>
- <b>Configure and manage Remote Access Server (RAS) features, including NAT/PAT.</b>
- <b>Implement and maintain essential network services such as DNS and DHCP.</b>
- <b>Set up and configure Windows File Servers with appropriate security measures.</b>



<h2>Technologies and Methodologies: </h2>

- <b>Windows Server 2019 for Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and file server roles.</b> 
- <b>PowerShell scripting for automation tasks related to user account management.</b> 
- <b>Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) for GPO configuration.</b> 
- <b>Remote Access Server (RAS) for NAT/PAT configuration.</b> 
- <b>NTFS (New Technology File System) for setting file and folder permissions.</b> 
- <b>Disk quotas to manage storage resources effectively.</b>
